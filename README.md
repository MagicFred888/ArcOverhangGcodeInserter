# Explanation of the Software
## G-Code Modifier for Overhang Printing Without Support

This open-source tool modifies G-Code files for 3D printing, specifically tailored to BambuLab printers. It enables the creation of models with overhangs, reducing or eliminating the need for traditional support structures by intelligently adjusting the G-Code.

## Key Features (Under Development)
Automatic Overhang Detection: Identifies areas of the model with overhangs that would typically require support.
Optimized for BambuLab Printers: Leverages the unique capabilities of BambuLab machines to implement precise modifications for superior results.
Automated Overhang Strategies: Automatically selects the best approach for handling overhangs, eliminating the need for manual fine-tuning.
Preview Capability: Offers a simulation preview of the modified G-Code, allowing users to review changes before printing.
## Development Status
This project is in an early development phase, with many features still being refined. Currently, it exclusively supports BambuLab printers. While this was initially created as a proof of concept for personal curiosity and testing, further feature development may be limited.

## Disclaimer
This software is actively under development and should be used with caution. It may not work reliably in all scenarios, so users are strongly advised to test the modified G-Code on small or non-critical prints before applying it to significant projects.
**The developers are not liable for any issues arising from the use of this software, including damage to hardware or print failures. Always follow best practices and safety guidelines when working with 3D printing equipment.**
